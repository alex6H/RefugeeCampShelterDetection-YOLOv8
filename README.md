# RefugeeCampShelterDetection-YOLOv8
This project automates counting shelters in a DRC refugee camp to estimate population. A drone's high-def image is analyzed with YOLOv8 by Ultralytics for detecting shelters and other categories. The SAHI library handles large images, and the model is trained on data from various camps. Future work will explore segmentation with models like SAM.
